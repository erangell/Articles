# Test Cases for dZeZ
- Since we are building a zzstructure from scratch, we can use the Gzz prototype to plan what needs to be tested by constructing zzstructures in it and comparing the behavior of the system under test to the behavior of the test zzstructure running in Gzz.

- So test cases can be constructed in Gzz and saved.  Documentation of the test cases and expected results should be included in nearby cells in the Gzz system.

- Upon exiting Gzz, the directory containing all the Gzz data is zipped and uploaded to this directory.  The dZeZ cases are above the Royal Families of Europe demo, which is kept for reference.  New dimensions for the tests are added below d.3.  

- First, get the Gzz demo running by following the instructions on Ted's website.  You will need Java installed and ZigZag-Gzz.jar needs to be on your desktop.

- Unzip the test case ZIP file to your desktop and enter a command such as:

```
java -jar desktop/ZigZag-Gzz.jar desktop/dZeZ
```

Click in the Ctrl window and type 9G then press Enter/Return to bring up the Edithack window.  As you move around the Data window (see Ted Nelson's documentation of the KBlang keyboard commands for more info) the text in the Edithack window will show the full text contents of the accursed cell (the blue cursor).

From the HOME cell, press i twice to move up to the dZeZ cell.  Move right to see the Test Cases.

As you work, think about best practices for using zzstructures and features that you wish were in Gzz that would improve your quality of life.

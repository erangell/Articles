Here is a public link to comments on the article on hypothes.is

https://via.hypothes.is/https://github.com/erangell/Articles/blob/master/dzezthoughts.md

If we wish to bring these comments into our hyperdrive, we would create a transclusion that points back to the hypothes.is url.  Then we would create comment links pointing to the text in the version of the document being commented on.  Import utilities would be applications that operate on dZeZ structures.

The importance of a common decentralized data layer is to provide portability of user data.  If hypothes.is had issues and people wished to take their data to another service, then a person who had imported it into a standard decentralized data structure would have their copy of the work available, as well as stored locally (a transclusion makes a local copy for personal/offline reference).

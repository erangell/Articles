When there is both a numbered file and a numbered directory, the tumbler refers to the numbered file (ex: 0.json).  Tumblers at lower levels refer to subdirectories of the numbered directory (ex: 0/1, 0/2)

0.json is a rich link structure which indicates that the document in directory 2 is a transclusion from a github URL.
The subdirectory 0 has file 1.json which contains the source URL.

The other directories (4, 5, and 9) refer to versions of the document.
They were named arbitrarily following this convention:
4 = 4th commit to the github repo = initial creation of the document
5 = 5th commit to the github repo = first revision of the document
9 = 9th commit = first revision that was distributed for comments.

Each directory at this level represents all activity for a single document.
2 represents the 2nd article written by this author.
The import of the contents into this hyperdrive is a transclusion of the source document.
The transclusion should be represented as a rich link: 
1. The tumbler of the creator of the link: 1111/0
2. The tumbler of the source : 1111/2/0/1 = URL of github document
3. The tumbler of the target : 1111/2 = tumbler containing all versions
4. The tumbler of the type of link : 1111/0/1/1 = transclusion link type

When there is both a numbered file and a numbered directory, the tumbler refers to the numbered file (ex: 0.json).  Tumblers at lower levels refer to subdirectories of the numbered directory (ex: 0/1, 0/2)

0.json is a rich link structure which indicates that the document in directory 2 is a transclusion from a github URL.
The subdirectory 0 has file 1.json which contains the source URL.

The other directories (4, 5, and 9) refer to versions of the document.
They were named arbitrarily following this convention:
4 = 4th commit to the github repo = initial creation of the document
5 = 5th commit to the github repo = first revision of the document
9 = 9th commit = first revision that was distributed for comments.

EDL (Edit-decision-list) is a currently undefined structure based on Ted Nelson's ideas.
It is essentially the instructions for creating a version of a document from spans of content.
For now, the output of a diff is being used as an EDL.
This file was created from the following line of cmpr.sh
diff ../4/1.md 1.md > 2.edl
It represents a "forward delta" which could reconstruct version 2 given version 1

This file was created from the following line of cmpr.sh

This directory is user 2222's personal transclusion of 1111's article.  1.json has the EDL for the full transclusion of version 9 of the article.

"richlink":"2222/1/1" = the tumbler for this rich link (points to this 1.json)
,"home":"2222/0" = the tumbler for the dimension list of this user/hyperdrive
,"from":"1111/2/9/1/0" = the starting point of the transclusion = first byte of 1111's document
,"to":"1111/2/9/1/5393" = the ending point of the transclusion = last byte of 1111's document
,"type":"2222/0/2/1" = zzcell that has the type of this rich link:	{"value":"transclusion",

Note: the mechanism for identifying byte ranges of a file is open for comments.
With the notation above, if there do not exist subdirectories named "0" or "5393"
The tumbler can be interpreted as a byte position.
An alternative can be to have both "from" and "to" point to "1111/2/9/1" which would 
indicate the entire contents of the 1.md file in 1111/2/9.

2222's local copy of version 9 of 1111's article (for offline use)
It will not be used by anyone else because the richlink identifies the tumbler 2222/1/1 
as a transclusion of the original article.  This implies ignoring any subdirectories
of that tumbler.  So the user can change their local copy as much as they want.
They can add files and subdirectories as desired.
If they share their version it will have a tumbler of 2222/1/1/1
The original transclusion richlink remains immutable.

In this directory, the commenter (2222) wishes to comment on the following line of 1111's article:

( see https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/259230/1/mSpace_zzStructures.pdf  )

in 2222's version, they wish to replace the above line with the following:

( see https://xanadu.com/zigzag )

The author (1111) doesn't agree with this change and will reject any pull request from 2222 to make the change.  However, 2222 can make that change to their personal transcluded copy of the article and essentially create their own fork, which future readers will know is a transclusion of 1111's article and be able to follow the rich link back to version 9 of 1111's hyperdrive.

Here is a public link to comments on the article on hypothes.is

https://via.hypothes.is/https://github.com/erangell/Articles/blob/master/dzezthoughts.md

If we wish to bring these comments into our hyperdrive, we would create a transclusion that points back to the hypothes.is url.  Then we would create comment links pointing to the text in the version of the document being commented on.  Import utilities would be applications that operate on dZeZ structures.

The importance of a common decentralized data layer is to provide portability of user data.  If hypothes.is had issues and people wished to take their data to another service, then a person who had imported it into a standard decentralized data structure would have their copy of the work available, as well as stored locally (a transclusion makes a local copy for personal/offline reference).
